# The Particles platform

Particles is a set of Node.js components (specifically [Scatter](https://github.com/mariocasciaro/scatter) particles) 
created to **work well together**. Particles is a *platform*, not a framework, 
it does not want to impose the use of any library or technology, instead, it wants to package ready-to-use solutions in 
the form of [Scatter](https://github.com/mariocasciaro/scatter) particles.
The idea is to have a set of components anyone can easily combine to create complete Node.js applications.

# Basic usage

Create a file called `app.js` (or whatever you like) and include the code below:

```javascript
require('particles').run();
```

That's it, now a new Scatter container is created, configured and the entry point (by default the Scatter service `app_start`)
will be invoked.

Attach any particles to your module to start composing your application.

Basic services like `config` and `log` are provided by default to all the particles attached to your application.
